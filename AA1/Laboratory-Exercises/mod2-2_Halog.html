			<h1>Spy x Family</h1>
			<p>During the period where politicians threaten each other with war, the two rival nations Westalis and Ostania are in a battle of information using spies. In order to gain intel on Ostania, a Westalis spy code-named as Twilight is sent on a mission to build a fake family. This is to infiltrate the prestigious school Eden Academy, where the son of Donovan Desmond goes to school. He adopts a girl named Anya and marries a woman named Yor Briar, unbeknownst to him that the two are hiding secrets as well.</p>
